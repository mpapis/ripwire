# Add a language to ripwire

You are adding a **new language** to ripwire: a vendored tree-sitter grammar, symbol extraction, and
the disclosure that says what the new grammar cannot see. Call it **LANG** below and substitute the
real one everywhere — the extension too (`.sql`, `.kt`, `.ml`).

This is not a tour. It is the path an actual language took, reconstructed from the Elixir grammar
that landed in v0.5.0 (`f3cc02e3` through `3021ee5f`), because a plausible-looking checklist written
from memory would send you to the wrong files. **Every path below is one that commit touched.**

Work in a git worktree, not the main checkout. Run gates in the foreground.

## STEP 0 — the measurement that decides whether to start

**Do this before writing any code, and be willing to stop here.**

Get a real corpus in LANG — thousands of files you did not write, ideally the ones you actually care
about. Run the candidate grammar over it and report **what fraction parses**.

A grammar that parses 95% of real-world LANG is worth vendoring. A grammar that parses 55% ships a
map whose honest header reads `unindexed="lang:1841"` on every run, and that is *worse than no
grammar at all* — a reader trusts a map that says nothing about LANG more than one that claims LANG
and silently loses half of it.

Dialects are where this bites: T-SQL vs ANSI, Kotlin vs Kotlin-with-compiler-plugins. Community
grammars usually target the standard dialect and degrade on vendor extensions.

**Write the parse rate down in the PR.** If it is low, that is a finding, not a failure — the honest
product may be lexical indexing with a disclosed floor rather than a grammar.

---

## STEP 1 — vendor the grammar (guardrail G3)

Grammars are compiled from source, pinned by commit SHA, and **never patched**. If the grammar is
wrong, fix it upstream; this repo does not carry a fork.

- `CMakeLists.txt` — `add_ts_grammar( LANG <git-url> <full-commit-sha> )`. Pin a SHA, never a tag or
  a branch. Then add `LANG` to the grammar list, `$<TARGET_OBJECTS:ts_LANG>` to the link line, the
  `ts_LANG` entry in the object list, and `add_ripwire_fuzzer( LANG tree_sitter_LANG LANG )`.
- `queries/LANG/tags.scm` — the capture file. Copy the closest existing language and cut it down;
  start with definitions only, no call edges.

The build must still complete **with the network off**. That is the point of vendoring.

---

## STEP 2 — register the language

- `src/model.h` — add to `enum class Lang`. **Append at the end**; the values are serialized into
  the cache, so reordering invalidates every cache in the world. `kLangCount` derives from the last
  entry, so it follows automatically. Add the `case Lang::LANG: return "ext";` arm.
- `src/ingest_crawl.h` — the extension table: `{ ".ext", Lang::LANG, &tree_sitter_LANG, "LANG" }`.
- `src/lintrules.h` — the extension→Lang map. Add to `dependencyCapable()` **only** if you are also
  doing STEP 5; claiming it without edges makes the `dep_files=` denominator lie.

---

## STEP 3 — extraction

**A language is data first, and C++ only where its semantics truly differ.** What is common must stay
common: twenty languages each carrying a private copy of the same idea is twenty places to fix one bug.

- `queries/LANG/tags.scm` — this is where most of a language lives. Use **only the shared capture
  vocabulary**: `@name`, `@definition.{function,method,class,struct,interface,var,constant,macro,module,type,field}`,
  `@reference.{call,import,implementation,type}`. Do not invent a language-named capture
  (`@definition.LANG`, `@LANG.head`); every consumer downstream has to learn a new name for it.
- The exhaustive `switch( Lang )` tables (`langTag`, `isCodeLang`, `dependencyCapable`, …) — the compiler
  lists every one you missed (`-Werror=switch`). A row each, no logic.
- Then the arms the compiler cannot see: `grep` for a recently added language (`Lang::Elixir`) and read
  every hit. Lists and masks are not switches — e.g. `kAllCatalogLangs` in `src/lintcatalog.h`, the
  `langBit` masks in `src/clones.h`, `wordLang` in `src/ingest_metrics.h`. Semantic hooks (arity,
  params, attributes) live today in the per-language branches of `src/ingest_sidecap.h`.
- Per-language C++ is for semantics the grammar cannot express. **Before writing a helper, look for the
  shared one:**

  | You need | Use (do not copy) |
  |---|---|
  | the scope a definition sits in | `enclosingScopeOf` (`src/ingest_names.h`) |
  | a local that shadows a global name (`let`, params) | a `VarDecl` binding with its block span — the generic shadow pass (`suppressShadowedReferences`) does the rest |
  | imports / aliases / `require … :as` | `Binding` / `Include` facts (`src/model.h`), as JS imports and Elixir aliases already do |
  | module-qualified calls (`Mod.f`, `ns/f`) | no language-neutral resolver exists yet; `src/elixir_resolve.h` is Elixir-specific and the only one. Raise generalising it in your PR rather than writing a `LANG_resolve.h` beside it |

  Then run `ripwire --clones` on your tree: your new code should add no clone group.
- **A qualified call you cannot resolve is counted as unresolved — never sent to the global name ladder.**
  `(str/join …)` laddered to every `join` in the corpus mints edges that are not real (the PR #81 decision:
  the ladder gave one Elixir function 55 callers where 3 were real).

**A known gap, so you are not surprised by it:** the tags pass does not evaluate `#eq?`/`#any-of?`
predicates yet (see the notes in `queries/javascript/tags.scm`). A language whose definitions are *a call
with a keyword head* — Elixir `def`, or a Lisp-style grammar (e.g. Clojure's `defn`, if added) — therefore has to keep that keyword list in C++ for
now. That is one reason `src/ingest_elixir.h` exists (it also holds arity, params, attribute and alias logic); it is **not a template to copy**. If you hit this, keep
the list a small `constexpr` table in one place, and say in the PR that it belongs in `tags.scm` once
predicates run. Maintainers will move it; you are not asked to build the mechanism.

If the shared mechanism you need does not exist, say so in the PR. We would rather add it with you than
see the pattern forked.

Extract **definitions with spans** first. Call edges are a separate round.

---

## STEP 4 — extraction identity, the trap that costs an afternoon

Two constants must move **in the same commit**:

    src/ingest_cache.h    kParserVer
    src/quality.h         kIngestParserVerMirror     MUST equal it (gated)

Miss the mirror and `qextractionkeycheck` fails reporting a version mismatch that reads like a
totally unrelated bug. Bump on **any** grammar, `.scm`, or extraction change — the cache is keyed on
it, and a stale cache serving old symbols for new code is the worst failure this tool has.

**Do not take the next integer blindly.** Parallel pull requests each need their own number, and the
maintainers assign you a parser version number in the PR.

Then regenerate `test/qschemetrip.hash` and update `test/printf_parity.manifest`.

---

## STEP 5 — dependency edges (optional, and a separate round)

Only if LANG has a resolvable import spelling. `src/resolve.h` (the extension→`IncludeLang` map and
the resolver arm), `src/ingest_relations.h`, and `dependencyCapable()` in `src/lintrules.h`.

**Six things read `dependencyCapable()`** — the one people miss is the co-change pair filter in
`src/gitmine.h`. Grep for every caller before you change it.

Resolve through the **corpus's own index**, never a name→path guess. A specifier that two files
answer must degrade to *neither*, not to the first one found.

---

## STEP 6 — disclosure: what the grammar cannot see

This is the step that makes the difference between a contribution and a liability.

Every language has blind spots — dynamic dispatch, macro-built names, a dialect the grammar declines.
Find yours and make the tool **say so in its output**, not in a comment:

- files that fail to parse fall back to lexical indexing and are **counted**, never silently dropped
- `kUnanalyzedLangs` if the lens cannot answer for LANG
- a count that cannot be a total carries `counts_floor="1"`
- a zero means *none found*, never *none exists*

Write the blind spots into the gate header. **A disclosure surface that under-reports is worse than
one that is absent.**

---

## TRAPS — each one cost somebody a day here

**A memo whose key is narrower than its inputs.** Found in PR #57 (Ruby constants) by an automated
reviewer, reproduced, and fixed before merge. If your resolution *walks* — tries `A::B::Name`, then
`A::Name`, then `Name` — and you memoize it, the key must carry the **whole chain**, not the
innermost frame. Two sites with the same innermost scope and different chains have different correct
answers.

What made it nasty: the wrong answer was **deterministic**, so the determinism arm passed. It varied
with *which other files were in the corpus*, and with their **filenames**, because crawl order
decides who poisons the memo first. In one order it invented an edge; in the other it suppressed a
correct one. Renaming a file changed the graph.

    a_nested.rb visits BEFORE the compact form   ->  2 edges   (one invented)
    z_nested.rb visits AFTER  the compact form   ->  0 edges   (one suppressed)
    correct answer, both orders                  ->  1 edge

Only languages with **lexically scoped name resolution** need a walk at all — Ruby constants today,
plausibly Kotlin or Scala imports. Elixir cannot have this bug: it looks up a fully-qualified name in
one `find()`, one key, one answer. If your language needs no walk, do not add a memo.

**A case-insensitive filesystem resolving a name you never meant.** macOS will happily answer a probe
for `Trackable` with `trackable.rb`. Plant a decoy in the fixture and assert the *right* file wins.

**The `Lang` enum is serialized into the cache.** Append only. Reordering invalidates every cache in
existence, silently, and the symptom appears somewhere else entirely.

---

## STEP 7 — the gate, written RED first

Write `test/LANGcheck.sh` **against a binary that does not yet have your change, and watch it fail.**
A gate that has never failed is not evidence it can detect anything.

Then register it in `test/regression.sh` in the **same commit** — `test/manifestcheck.sh` fails
otherwise.

Fixtures go in `test/LANGfix/`. Make them adversarial, not illustrative:

- a **decoy** — the same symbol name in a file that must *not* win
- a case-collision, if the filesystem could resolve it wrongly
- a construct the grammar handles badly, asserting the *disclosed* behaviour

Arms worth having, from `test/elixircheck.sh` and `test/rubyrequirecheck.sh`:

    definitions land with the right spans
    the decoy does not win
    two runs are byte-identical            (determinism is a contract)
    warm == cold                           (survives the cache round-trip)
    output is well-formed XML
    a relative and an absolute crawl root resolve identically

---

## STEP 8 — before you open the PR

    cmake -S . -B build && cmake --build build -j
    python3 test/pargates.py . ./build/ripwire -j 6          # the full suite
    cmake -S . -B asan -DRIPWIRE_ASAN=ON && cmake --build asan -j
    LSAN_OPTIONS=suppressions=lsan_suppressions.txt ./asan/ripwire <corpus> >/dev/null

Build **fresh**, not incrementally — a language change touches `src/model.h`, and an incremental
build across that produces objects that disagree about `sizeof(Symbol)`. `CONTRIBUTING.md` and
`CLAUDE.md` document what that looks like; it costs hours and every symptom points somewhere else.

In the PR, state: **the parse rate from STEP 0**, the corpus you measured on, and the blind spots you
disclosed. Those three are what the review is actually about — the grammar is the easy part.
