#!/usr/bin/env bash
# mentionsverbcheck.sh — §A8.4 gate: --mentions=SYM's docs= counted
# markdown SECTIONS while the rows printed FILES — a doc with several backtick mentions of SYM under
# different headings inflated docs= (main.cpp uniques g.mentions' section NodeIds, one per enclosing
# Section, then prints each one's FILE path) and repeated the same p= across rows, both wrong: the
# attribute name says "docs" but the number was sections, and a reader summing rows double(triple)-
# counted one file.
#
# THE FIX: rows collapse to one per FILE, carrying mentions="N" (that file's own section-mention count).
# The root's docs= now names what it prints (the row count, distinct files) and sections= keeps the old
# section-node tally so nothing measured is lost. V2-2: NO l= — the doc edge is stored at file granularity
# (graph.h keeps the doc FILE node, line always 1), so an emitted l= read as a locator while carrying zero
# information; a row must not carry a fake locator.
#
# Fixture: pkg/alpha.py defines widget_pipeline_process. multi.md backtick-mentions it THREE times: once
# in body prose under no specific heading (attributes to the file-level Section — every ripwire markdown
# file gets one, spanning the whole file) and twice more directly ON a heading's own line ("## `sym`
# details" — a heading span covers only its own line, so a backtick THERE binds a DIFFERENT enclosing
# Section than body prose below it). That is 3 distinct (def, enclosing-Section) edges in ONE file — the
# exact shape that inflated docs=3x pre-fix. single.md mentions it once, for a plain 1x control.
#
# Usage:  bash test/mentionsverbcheck.sh   |   RIPWIRE_BIN=asan/ripwire bash test/mentionsverbcheck.sh
#         RIPWIRE_BIN=build_base/ripwire bash test/mentionsverbcheck.sh    # must FAIL (pre-fix binary)
# 7) THE BACKTICK RULE'S RESIDUE (lane honesty-cuts-066): docs= counts only a clean one-line backtick span, so prose, a
#    code block or a span broken across lines never counted, and nothing said so (--mentions=escapeXml read docs="2"
#    while three more files named it). unbackticked_docs=N counts the markdown files that name it only that way,
#    present only when non-zero, defined in the same document; the two fixture docs above name it only in backticks.
#    The MCP `mentions` twin carries it as "unbackticked_docs" with "unbackticked_docs_ceiling":true beside it.
#
# Exits non-zero on any failure. Self-contained (own temp dir). Does NOT edit test/regression.sh.
