# traceasanlinearcheck.sh — --from-trace's ASan frame parser (src/tracein.h detail::parseAsan) is LINEAR
# in the trace text's size, not quadratic.
#
# THE DEFECT. parseAsan finds the source location on an ASan/UBSan frame line (`#0 0x.. in FUNC
# path:line:col`) by trying the LAST space-separated token first, then the last two, then the last
# three, … — because a demangled C++ function name can itself contain spaces
# (`rw::alpha(int const&)`), so the split cannot just be the first space. The original implementation
# re-derived the whole candidate on every widening try (rfind(':')/rfind(' ')/looksLikePath over a
# substring that only grows), which redoes the SAME work at every step: O(k^2) in the space-separated
# word count k. A line built from thousands of short, non-path-shaped "words" with no valid trailing
# location anywhere (the pattern a fuzzer, a minified diagnostic dump, or a pasted non-stack-trace blob
# produces) turned 160 KB of trace text into ~4 s of one --from-trace call.
#
# THE FIX. Every quantity the naive rescan recomputed is actually INVARIANT once the growing window
# first reaches it (a colon's position never moves; "does this stretch contain '.'/'/'" can only flip
# false->true as the window grows left, never back), so parseAsan now computes each ONCE and walks word
# boundaries in a single backward pass — O(after.size()) total, not O(words^2) — landing on the exact
# same candidate the original per-word rescan would have found first.
#
# Arms:
#   (A) CORRECTNESS — a real multi-word demangled frame (`rw::alpha(int const&) src/mod.cpp:8:1`, the
#       same shape test/tracecheck.sh's (A2a) fixture uses) still extracts path=src/mod.cpp, line=8 and
#       the whole func string, not a naive first-space split.
#   (B) NEAR-LINEAR TIMING — a PATHOLOGICAL line (many thousands of short, non-path-shaped words, one
#       lone path character planted in the very FIRST word so every candidate up to the last is tried
#       and fails, ending in a real `:digits` so the trailing-digit check alone cannot short-circuit) at
#       roughly 40 KB / 160 KB / 640 KB / 2.5 MB: each ~4x size step must cost roughly a ~4x time step,
#       not the ~16x a real O(k^2) would show. Generous slack (8x) keeps this off CI noise while still
#       catching a genuine quadratic regression, which blows the ratio by 100x+ at the top end. Each size
#       is timed 5 times, round-robin, and the ratios compare MEDIANS (#352: one stalled sample failed B1).
#   (C) REGRESSION — an ordinary single-space ASan frame (test/tracecheck.sh's own fixture) still parses.
#
# MUTATION CONTROL: arm B is exactly what a revert to the per-candidate rescan trips — arm A and C still
# pass (the algorithm is a rewrite, not a capability change), only the TIMING ratio in B goes red. Run
# against a pre-fix binary — RIPWIRE_BIN=<base>/ripwire bash test/traceasanlinearcheck.sh — arm B must FAIL.
# Re-proven for the median form (#352): a per-word `after.substr( start ).find_first_of( "./" )` rescan planted in
# scanAsanWordBoundaries measured medians 132 / 1033 / 14094 ms / timeout and failed B1, B2 and B3.
#
# Usage:  bash test/traceasanlinearcheck.sh   |   RIPWIRE_BIN=asan/ripwire bash test/traceasanlinearcheck.sh
#
# Exits non-zero on any failure; prints PASS/FAIL per check and ALL PASS on success.
