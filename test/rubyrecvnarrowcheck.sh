# rubyrecvnarrowcheck.sh — gate for Ruby CONSTANT-RECEIVER call narrowing: `Calc.add(1,2)`,
# `Outer::Engine.run(3)`, `::Top.ping`, `Util.format(5)` resolve to the method defined under THAT
# constant, instead of splitting across every same-named method in the corpus.
#
# What was wrong, and where. resolve.h's Rule 2c (docs/EVALS.md "Phase 4b") already says "the receiver
# token IS the type": a `Cls.m(…)` call whose receiver names a class-like definition resolves against
# that class. It never fired for Ruby, because ingest_binds.h::classifyReceiver accepted a receiver node
# of kind (identifier) only. Ruby's class/module receiver is its OWN node kind — (constant) for `Calc`,
# (scope_resolution) for `Outer::Engine` and `::Top` — so every such call classified RecvKind::None,
# receiverOf then stamped it FieldOfVar with an empty recvVar ("a member access, receiver undecidable"),
# and the resolver fell through to the §2a name spray. Measured before the fix on the four Ruby corpora:
# activerecord 8.1.3 lib = 9,116 edges with ambiguous=1,496 and declined=4,576; a 4,683-file Rails app
# = 23,784 edges with declined=12,485. Constant-receiver call SITES in that same text: 3,176 and 9,499.
#
# The rule, stated so it can be disagreed with:
#   * The receiver's FINAL constant segment is the type name — `Outer::Engine` → `Engine`, `::Top` → `Top`.
#     That is the same final-segment convention Rule 2's type bindings already use (`ns::Foo` → `Foo`),
#     and it meets Symbol::scope, which is the IMMEDIATE enclosing name by design (ingest_sidecap.h).
#   * A (scope_resolution) whose `name:` child is not a (constant) is not a constant receiver at all.
#     `Outer::run(1)` is not that shape — tree-sitter-ruby parses it as an ordinary (call) with receiver
#     (constant) `Outer`, exactly like `Outer.run(1)`, and both narrow through the (constant) arm.
#   * A Ruby MODULE is a receiver of class methods as much as a class is (`Util.format`). `@definition.module`
#     maps to SymKind::Other (ingest_crawl.h::defKind) for every language, and in Ruby that kind is reached
#     by nothing else — queries/ruby/tags.scm emits class, module, method and constant, and the other three
#     have kinds of their own — so buildGraph's Rule 2c class-name set takes Ruby's SymKind::Other symbols.
#   * A MISS never deletes an edge: the receiver naming no in-repo definition (`Time.now`), or naming one
#     that does not define the callee, degrades to the unchanged honest ladder.
#
# Stated floors, pinned below so each stays a decision rather than an accident:
#   (a) LIFTED at parser version 98 by test/rubyinheritcheck.sh (`class Child < Parent` now mints an
#       inherit ref, so chaUp holds Ruby and the base walk runs). The arm below is kept, INVERTED: it
#       now asserts `Child.build` pins to Parent::build, and it is the tripwire that fires if Ruby ever
#       loses its inheritance edges again.
#   (b) Matching is by FINAL SEGMENT, so two classes with the same last name in different namespaces
#       both defining the callee keep BOTH candidates (an honest split), exactly as Rule 2c documents.
#   (c) A variable receiver (`c.scale`) and a chained one (`Calc.new.scale`) are untouched by this round.
#   (d) A constant receiver whose class defines BOTH `def self.x` and `def x` gets an honest two-way split that
#       includes the instance method (rails `Journey::Parser.parse`): a split, not a pin. Ruby's tags.scm gives
#       `method` and `singleton_method` one kind, so telling them apart is a later round.
