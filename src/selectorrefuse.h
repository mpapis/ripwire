// selectorrefuse.h — THE ONE "that selector named no symbol" refusal every SYM-taking CLI verb prints.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS (§B4.2). Six verbs take the same `file:name` selector grammar and six verbs refused a
// BAD one in two different dialects. --uses had grown the honest message: it says what is actually wrong
// ("that file defines no 'rankGraphTeleport'"), names the files that DO define the name, and hands back a
// runnable retry. Its five siblings — --edit-check / --callers / --callees / --impact / --around / --lego —
// answered a bare "symbol not found" about a symbol that plainly EXISTS, which reads as "you typed a name
// that isn't here" when the true fault is the file half. An agent believes the first message and goes
// looking for a rename that never happened.
//
// The asymmetry was not a decision, it was one enrichment that landed on one arm — the same "one shared
// guard, N arms" class as the V2-1 qualified-spelling guard. So the message moves HERE and every arm calls
// it; a seventh SYM-taking verb inherits the enrichment by calling the function, not by remembering to copy
// a paragraph. --uses' own wording is preserved verbatim (it was the good one), so its bytes are unchanged
// except for the shared file-list cap below.
//
// Deliberately CLI-side: the MCP arms have their own refusal vocabulary in mcprefusal.h (different surface,
// different retry syntax, JSON-RPC framing). What the two share is didyoumean.h, which both already call —
// and, since the @FILE:LINE round, atSeedFaultClause below: the at-diagnosis sentences are per-fault FACTS,
// not surface prose, so mcprefusal.h speaks them verbatim (mcprefuse::atSeedClause) rather than re-wording
// the same seven faults a second time.

// defaulted `specTail` parameter on selectorNotFoundMessage would have done the same job while CHANGING that
// function's arity, i.e. its contract, for every existing caller — a clause of its own costs nothing and
// leaves the shared sentence untouched.
//
// THREE outcomes, and which one fires is a FACT about the selector, never a guess:
//   • a `file:name` spelling whose FILE half matches no indexed path ⇒ the path is the fault, and nothing can
//     be said about the name half. Say that instead (§M7 partial, W3FIX: the enriched branch used to assert
//     "that file defines no 'X'" for a file that was never indexed — a claim about a file the tool never read,
//     which sends an agent hunting for a rename in a header that does not exist under that spelling).
//   • a `file:name` spelling whose FILE half IS indexed and whose NAME half resolves somewhere ⇒ the file half
//     is the fault. Say so, name every file that does define it, and give the first as a ready-to-run retry.
//   • anything else ⇒ the name itself is unknown: a near-miss if one exists, otherwise nothing.
// A canonical id ("path::scope::name") is NOT file-qualified — splitQualifiedSpec would cut it at its last
// colon and the resulting "file" half is a scope, not a path — so it takes the last branch, exactly as
// resolveUsesSelector already ruled for --uses.
// The @FILE:LINE half of the diagnosis — ONE sentence per AtFault value, shared verbatim between the at
// flag's own refusal and every SYM-taking verb's selector clause, so the same fault is never described two
// ways. Each sentence states the FACT the resolver established and the retry that acts on it; the resolver
// itself never guesses (graph.h::resolveAtSeed), so neither does the prose.
